- Only use these three codes, set to null for any other type

PERCENTAGE EXTRACTION:
- Convert fractions to decimals (e.g., 1/4 = 25.0, 3/8 = 37.5)
- Extract percentages as numbers (e.g., "25.5%" becomes 25.5)
- If multiple percentages exist, use the primary/largest one
- Set to null if no percentage information found

Requirements:
- Must have name/company AND address

EXTRACT:
- Names (individuals, companies, trusts)
- Complete addresses
- Phone/email if present
- Ownership info (percentages, interest types)
- Mineral rights ownership percentage (as decimal, e.g., 25.5 for 25.5%)

PRIORITY SOURCES (extract ALL):
- Postal delivery tables/certified mail lists
- Transaction report, Transaction Report Details, CertifiedPro.net reports
- **Tables with columns like "Name 1", "Name 2", "Address1", "Address2" - these are recipient lists**
- Interest owner tables (WI, ORRI, MI, UMI owners)
- Revenue/mailing lists
- **Tract ownership breakdowns (pages with "Summary of Interests" by tract)**
- **Unit-level ownership summaries (consolidated ownership across all tracts)**

SPECIAL FORMATS:
- **For tables with "Name 1" and "Name 2" columns:**
  * Combine Name 1 and Name 2 as a single entity
  * If Name 2 is blank, use only Name 1
  * Example: Name 1="Bureau of Land Management", Name 2="Department of the Interior, USA" â†’ company="Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior, USA"
- Combine Address1 and Address2 fields into complete address
- Extract all rows regardless of "Mailing Status" column

OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE:
- Units contain multiple Tracts
- Extract BOTH tract-level AND unit-level ownership
- Unit-level summary typically appears as:
  * "Summary of Interests"
  * "Matador Working Interest" / "Voluntary Joinder" / "Compulsory Pool Interest"
  * Tables showing working interest percentages by tract
  * Overall interest owner breakdowns

EXCLUDE (skip entirely):
- Attorneys, lawyers, law firms
- Legal professionals (Esq., J.D., P.C., P.A., PLLC, LLP)
- Legal services/representatives
EXCEPTION: Include trusts/trustees from postal/interest tables (they're owners, not lawyers)

POSTAL TABLES:
- Ignore tracking numbers, USPS Article Numbers, mailing dates, reference numbers
- Extract recipient names from ANY name field (Name, Name 1, Name 2, Recipient Name)
- Combine all address components (Address1, Address2, Street Address, City, State, Zip)
- Trusts go in "company" field with full dtd notation

}

OWNERSHIP TYPE MAPPING:
- WI = Working Interest
- ORRI = Overriding Royalty Interest
- UMI = Unleased Mineral Interest
- Only use these three codes, set to null for any other type (including MI, Committed, Uncommitted)

PERCENTAGE EXTRACTION:
- Convert fractions to decimals (e.g., 1/4 = 25.0, 3/8 = 37.5)
- Extract percentages as numbers (e.g., "25.5%" becomes 25.5)
- If multiple percentages exist, use the primary/largest one
- Set to null if no percentage information found

OWNERSHIP PRIORITY:
1. Extract unit-level summary first (this is the overall ownership across all tracts)
2. Then extract individual tract breakdowns
3. Mark unit_level: true for consolidated ownership, false for tract-specific

Requirements:
- Must have name/company AND (address OR ownership_info)
- Remove duplicates (same owner across multiple tracts = one record with all tracts listed)
- When uncertain if legal professional, exclude UNLESS from postal/interest table
- For owners appearing in multiple tracts, consolidate into single record with all tract numbers
- **Process every row in postal/transaction tables even if status shows "Mailed", "Delivered", or other**
- No text outside JSON array
